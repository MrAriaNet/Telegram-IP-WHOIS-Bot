# Telegram WHOIS Bot

A simple Telegram bot that provides **WHOIS information** for any IPv4/IPv6 address, including the **country flag**. Works via **Webhook** and also has a **CLI test mode**.

---

## Features

* Responds to `/start` and `/help` commands.
* Fetches WHOIS info using [Tizian Maxime Weigt's API](https://github.com/Tizian-Maxime-Weigt/IP-to-ASN-and-Whois-API).
* Displays **country flag** next to the country code.
* Works in **Webhook mode** for Telegram.
* **CLI test mode** for quick local testing.
* Ignores unnecessary fields like `logo` from the API.
